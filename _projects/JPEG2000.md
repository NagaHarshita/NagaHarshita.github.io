<!-- ## Algorithm 

Given an image(set of pixels), we can construct a 64 * 64 image with less no of pixels known acheived by wavelet transform. 

This JPEG 2000 algorithm is best for maintaining the different qualities of the image, so that it is easy to send images in the network according to the bandwidth.

Apply the low pass and high pass filters along the row and column will reduce the no of coefficients that need to be sent through compression. 

Ideally, given an image it will be broken down to tiles and applied this JPEG2000 algorithm. 

**Low Pass Filter**

Allow low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating high-frequency signals
$$ (a + b) / 2 $$

**High Pass Filter** 

Allow high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating low-frequency signals
$$ (a - b) / 2 $$

### Discrete Wavelet Transform




### Wavelet Compression 




### Progressive Encoding  -->
