## 1. Introduction

Serverless computing has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm in cloud computing, offering developers the ability to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. However, this model introduces unique challenges, particularly in terms of performance variability due to the "cold start" phenomenon.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of cold start times across major cloud platforms, investigating the factors that influence these delays and offering insights to optimize serverless function performance.

### 1.1 Cold Start in Serverless Computing

A "cold start" occurs when a serverless function is executed in a newly created container, as opposed to reusing an existing warm container. This process introduces latency that can significantly impact application performance, especially for latency-sensitive applications.

The typical steps involved in a cold start are:
1. Server allocation
2. Container setup with specified runtime
3. Loading of required dependencies and packages
4. Loading of function code into memory
5. Execution of function handler code

In contrast, a warm start only involves the last step, as it reuses an existing container.

### 1.2 Significance of the Study

Understanding and mitigating cold start issues is crucial for:
- Optimizing application performance
- Improving user experience
- Managing costs effectively in serverless environments
- Designing efficient serverless architectures

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Serverless Computing Landscape

Serverless computing, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), has gained significant traction since its introduction. Major cloud providers offering serverless platforms include:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Lambda
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud Functions
- Microsoft Azure with Azure Functions

### 2.2 Previous Research

Several studies have explored cold start times in serverless environments:
- Manner et al. (2018) investigated factors influencing cold starts in FaaS platforms.
- Jackson and Clynch (2018) examined the impact of language runtime on serverless function performance and cost.
- Cordingly et al. (2020) analyzed the implications of programming language selection for serverless data processing pipelines.

Our study builds upon this foundation, providing a more recent and comprehensive analysis across multiple platforms.
