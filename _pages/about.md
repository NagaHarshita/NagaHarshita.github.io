I'm Harshita, a software engineer and data enthusiast on a mission to leverage technology for meaningful impact. With a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for innovative problem-solving, I immerse myself in creating solutions that make a real difference.

My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for how things work. This curiosity led me to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, where I honed my technical skills and gained valuable experience in software development. During my time at USC, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that deepened my understanding of the field and sparked my passion for creating innovative solutions.
